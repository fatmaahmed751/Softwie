# Softwie
This APP For Softwie Company Interview 
this App contain a lot of features like :
Firebase Services:
*authantication with email and password
*Firebase Database to store users who authanicate with this app 

Bloc as state managment: 
* using Bloc pattern to integrate the app with firebase back end
* using Bloc pattern to integrate the app with API services to fetch and search products using text avlue

API as Application Programming Interface :
*using dummy data to use methods of http packages to get and search data then provide it in our APP

MVC Pattern
*using controller and data handler to sperate UI from logic 

Router configurate:
*using router configue to naviagate between screens easily 

services of APP:
*login service
*register service
*request service from the company
*update user profile
*notifications

Using Android Studio as IDE and Flutter 3.22.2 SDK 

Using Git as Control version :
* first I push the init folders to the master branch this folders contain templates which using in all general Applicatios .
* then I create a remote branch to push the upadtes of my code using seprated branchs which include UI code and Data code
* pushing the updates code with commit text to able to return the code easily

here's my Github repository link :
*
when I face this issue:
*The application's UI is not updating as expected after data changes:
/first I spaerated the widgets in my screen which rely on each other to raech for the error .
/and log a many of print statement in places which I discover the error from this widget 
/and also run the debug mode to raech to the error fastly
/Check for any missing or incorrect bindings.
/If using a state management library (Bloc,provider), confirm that the state is being updated correctly and that the UI is subscribed to the relevant state changes.
/Use async/await or .then() to handle asynchronous updates properly.

 Explain how you would describe the importance of efficient state management in Flutter to a non-technical stakeholder.

**For a non-technical person, I can explain the importance of efficient state management in Flutter using a simple analogy.
Imagine you are building a house. In this house, you have many rooms, furniture, and appliances that need to work together in harmony. If there is no organized way to manage these elements, the house could become chaotic, and things might not function as intended.
*In Flutter applications, "state" is like the furniture and appliances in the house. Efficient state management means we organize how these elements work so that they operate smoothly and efficiently. Without proper state management, the app could become slow, malfunction, or make it difficult to add new features in the future.
In short, efficient state management helps us build fast, maintainable, and scalable applications, ensuring a better experience for users and making the development process easier for the team.
